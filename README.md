# Credicxo-Tech-Internship
Python Data Extraction Engineering internship at Credicxo Tech Private Limited.

## Steps:
run main.py

## Approach:
Amazon detects browsers so we need to use different user-agents.
some items have fixed price and some have a list of different sellers. Need to cinsider both.
need to use selenium for some pages that do not like the user-agent provided.

read csv-> create url -> request url with headers -> unsuccessful ? -> no -> scrape data -> add to json variable -> save to .json file after 100 urls
                                                            |                       |
                                                            -> yes -> use selenium ->
